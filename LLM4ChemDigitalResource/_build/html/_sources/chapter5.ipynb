        "\n",
        "The explosion of chemical literature has made it difficult for researchers to keep up with new findings. Large language models (LLMs) provide a powerful way to mine this vast knowledge. This chapter explores how LLMs transform literature interaction, starting with the scale and complexity of today’s journals and the limits of manual or rule-based mining. We then cover automated techniques powered by LLMs—such as chemical named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and parsing of experimental sections.  \n",
        "\n",
        "We further show how extracted data can form **knowledge bases or graphs**, organizing reactions, properties, and relationships beyond traditional databases. LLM-driven analysis of literature can also inspire new hypotheses and guide research directions. Practical examples, code snippets, and case studies demonstrate these ideas, highlighting that LLMs are not just tools for text, but catalysts for **knowledge discovery in chemistry**.  \n"

        "\n",
        "A core task in text mining is **entity extraction**—identifying mentions of key items within text. In chemistry, these entities often include compounds, materials, reactions, properties, experimental conditions, and instruments. For example, **chemical named entity recognition (CNER)** targets chemical names such as *aspirin*, *H₂SO₄*, or *acetylsalicylic acid*.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Building on this, **relationship extraction** identifies how entities connect. Examples include linking a compound to a property (*“aspirin has a melting point of 135 °C”*) or mapping reagents to a reaction outcome (*“benzene under condition X yields phenol”*).  \n",
        "\n",
        "LLMs can serve as powerful chemical entity recognizers. With well-designed prompts, an LLM can perform CNER dynamically, leveraging its contextual understanding gained during training. Unlike classical NER systems that depend on fixed vocabularies or labeled datasets, an LLM can infer roles from context. For instance, given the sentence:  \n",
        "\n",
        "*“We dissolved the sample in ethyl acetate.”*  \n",
        "\n",
        "A traditional algorithm might miss the solvent if it were not in its dictionary, whereas an LLM can infer that *ethyl acetate* functions as a solvent in this context.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** Consider the sentence:  \n",
        "*“The mixture of benzaldehyde and NaBH₄ was stirred in methanol at 0 °C.”*  \n",
        "\n",
        "A prompt to an LLM could extract:  \n",
