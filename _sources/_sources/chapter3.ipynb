        "This part of the chapter applies theory and tools through hands-on examples, focusing on molecule manipulation, standardization, reaction handling, and visualization. Molecule manipulation includes programmatic changes such as adding hydrogens, applying reactions, or generating standardized forms to clean inconsistent data (e.g., removing counter-ions or salts from vendor libraries). For instance, RDKit can split a compound like `CC(=O)[O-].[Na+]` (sodium acetate) into fragments with `Chem.GetMolFrags`, allowing us to retain the main molecule (acetate) while discarding smaller fragments (such as sodium or solvents). These steps ensure that molecules are in a consistent form for modeling, while 2D and 3D visualization aids interpretation and communication of results.  \n",

        "**Example:** Consider sodium acetate, which in SMILES can be written as `CC(=O)[O-].[Na+]`. Using RDKit, we can split this into fragments and keep the main organic molecule (acetate) while discarding the sodium counter-ion. This ensures that the data is standardized and suitable for modeling or further analysis.  "
